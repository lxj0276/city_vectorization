#Cairo Library

**Introduction:**

Cairo is a 2d graphics library, which supports drawing on SVG files.
I suggest reading more about cairo here: http://cairographics.org/tutorial/ and here: http://cairographics.org/samples/
You can find the API somewhere on that site, too.

**Installation[short]:**
* Include the `include` folder, which contains cairo's header files inside the `cairo` folder
* Include the `lib` folder, add `cairo.lib` dependency
* Include the `cairo.dll`:
  * Option 1: add `PATH=%PATH%;$(ProjectDir)lib` to your environment
  * Option 2: copy `cairo.dll` to the projects output folder

**Installation[long]** (for Visual Studio 2015, but should work for older version too):

1. Open Project Properties
2. Open *C/C++* -> *General*, under *Additional Include Directories*, add `$(ProjectDir)include`
3. Open *Linker* -> *General*, under *Additional Library Directories*, add `$(ProjectDir)lib`
4. Open *Linker* -> *Input*, under *Additional Dependencies*, add `cairo.lib`
5. Use either option:
	1. Move/Copy `$(ProjectDir)\lib\cairo.dll` to your working directory, usually in the folder before `\lib` where all the source files are
	2. Open *Configuration Properties* -> *Debugging*, under *Environment*, add `PATH=%PATH%;$(ProjectDir)lib`
	

In your source code, if you want to use cairo (with svg support), add
```
#include <cairo\cairo.h>
#include <cairo\cairo-svg.h>
```

**Usage**

I recommend looking at the sites linked at the top.

Alternatively, there's also a [code-sample](/sample/cairo.cpp) inside the sample folder.

*Appendix: I pulled the (x64) compiled libraries and header files from [https://github.com/tordex/cairo](https://github.com/tordex/cairo) , if you use a x86 environment, you should get the correct libraries from there.*
